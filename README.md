## What is Auto Payload Positioner?

A Burp Suite extension built on the Montoya API that automatically detects and marks ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù insertion points throughout an HTTP request. Rather than manually highlighting each location (headers, parameters, JSON/XML/form bodies, etc.), this extension sets payload positions for you‚Äîso you can focus on testing vulnerabilities, not on placement.

Watch the demo!

)

## Features

- Automatic detection of insertion points

  - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)

  - Last path segment of the URL

  - URL query parameters

  - Form data parameters
  
  - Header values (Cookie, Authorization, and all other headers)

  - JSON bodies (keys, values, nested objects/arrays)

  - XML bodies (tag content, attributes)

  - Embedded formats and key=value pairs in text/plain or mixed bodies

- Context-menu integration

  - Right-click on any request in Proxy, Target, Intruder, or Repeater

  - Select Set positions to auto-mark insertion points

- Intruder-ready

  - Builds an HttpRequestTemplate with all detected ranges

  - Sends the request directly to Intruder with your custom positions

- Robust range validation

  - Filters out invalid, overlapping, or out-of-bounds ranges

  - Ensures stable behavior even on complex requests
